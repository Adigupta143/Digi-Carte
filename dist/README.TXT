The objective of my project is to develop an online Digital Menu Software through which Customers can order food
digitally at the restaurant rather than standing in queues or waiting for a waiter to attend to them.
It assists the manager of the restaurant to get feedback from the customers online and view and manage the profiles of
chefs in the restaurant.
It helps in cost-cutting of the expenses of restaurants, and orders are quickly done and shown on the chef window.
Overall, it revolutionizes the dining experience for the visiting customers.
